Vehicle data â€“ to use the App you will need to register as least one vehicle. The app will use the vehicle registration number to identify the vehicle and specification and as you use the app all journeys, fuel expenses, servicing and maintenance, incident history will be stored against this vehicle.  Data will be used primarily to enable the functionality of the app. The App provider on an anonymised basis to provide data for research purposes will also use this data.&lt;/"/>
